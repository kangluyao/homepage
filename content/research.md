I am a broadly trained microbiome researcher, mainly interested in understanding 1) the microbial biogeographic patterns and the underlying causes; 2) the responses of microorganisms to the climate changes in alpine ecosystems. My research is motivated by a need for a better understanding of rules of microbial compositional assemblage and functional attributes during the current era of global changes. My research is interdisciplinary, integrating tools and perspectives of microbial ecology, biogeography, species distribution modelings (DDRs), meta-analyses and metagenomes.

During my Ph.D stage in IBCAS, I investigated the biogeographic patterns and underlying assemblage mechanisms of the belowground communities (i.e. bacteria, fungi, protists, and metazoa) on the Tibetan alpine grassland ([Kang et al. 2022, *Environmental microbiology*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1462-2920.15827)).

In addition, I have reveled the underlying causes of the microbial biodiversity and their difference between high-altitude and high-latitude permafrost thawing lakes across the Northern Hemisphere ([Kang et al. 2023, *Global Ecology and Biogeography*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/geb.13764)).

I also completed a project recently investigating the large-scale stratigraphic microbial biogeochemical profiles using metagenomic techniques on the Tibetan alpine permafrost region (Kang et al. 2023, in preparation).
